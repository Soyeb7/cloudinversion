          <h2>Ideal Conditions for Cloud Inversions</h2>
          <p>
            Cloud inversions require a specific set of atmospheric conditions to form. Here are the key conditions that favor the formation of a cloud inversion:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear Skies:</strong> Sky conditions should be clear or with less than 25% cloud cover to allow the ground to cool rapidly.</li>
            <li><strong>Light Winds:</strong> Winds should be calm or light, typically below 3 meters per second (6.7 mph), to maintain stable air layers.</li>
            <li><strong>High Humidity:</strong> Relative humidity near the surface should be above 80-85% to support cloud or fog formation.</li>
            <li><strong>Cold Overnight Temperatures:</strong> Surface temperatures should drop below 10째C (50째F) overnight, with a sharp difference compared to higher altitudes.</li>
            <li><strong>Warmer Air at Higher Altitudes:</strong> Temperatures at higher altitudes (850 hPa) should be above 5째C (41째F) and warmer than at the surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Transitions:</strong> After a few days of cold, calm conditions, an approaching change to milder, wetter weather increases the chances of cloud inversion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These factors combined create a stable atmospheric environment conducive to a cloud inversion, which often results in stunning views of fog or clouds trapped in valleys or low-lying areas.
